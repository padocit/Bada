# Bada
Bada Renderer

## No Assets
Temporarily not including 'Assets' folder in this repo.
Because it's too large to upload here.

## The plan

- Multi-platform Renderer (DX12, Vulkan, Metal...)
- Physically Based-Shading
- Raytracing, Path tracing
- Can be implemented to Game-Engine
  - Core = lib
  - backends = dll

# How to build

1. git clone
2. Scripts/Setup-Windows.bat
3. Check 'packages' folder is loaded in solution path by nuget
4. Open the solution and build.
